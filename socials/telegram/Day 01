# Telegram Post – Day 01

## 📝 Summary:
In this Telegram post, I explained how the BubuVerse ecosystem works from a player and guild perspective.  
I highlighted the importance of the Mystery Box, daily missions, energy farming, and how guild activity affects overall rankings.

The post also talks about the project's steady development — evolving Bubus, new realms, a creator system, and future features that make the ecosystem grow consistently.

Finally, I shared useful links for users who want to join the project or explore BubuVerse further.
