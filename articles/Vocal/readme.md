# Vocal Media Articles

This folder contains all long-form Vocal Media posts I publish daily.  
Each file represents one Vocal article with unique insights, storytelling, and Web3 commentary.

## How files are organized
- day01.md — Day 1 content  
- day02.md — Day 2 content  
- day03.md — Day 3 content  
(...and so on)

## What each article should include
- Title  
- Summary  
- Main content (on Vocal page)  
- Link to the published post  
- Optional notes, tags, or updates
