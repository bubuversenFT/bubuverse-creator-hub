# Tumblr Posts

This folder contains all Tumblr posts I publish as part of the BubuVerse daily content schedule.  
These posts include visuals, atmospheric moments, short writings, and creative world-building entries.

## How files are organized
- day01.md — Day 1 Tumblr post  
- day02.md — Day 2 Tumblr post  
- day03.md — Day 3 Tumblr post  
(...and so on)

## What each Tumblr post should include
- Title  
- Short summary  
- Link to the Tumblr post  
- Optional images, descriptions, or creative notes
