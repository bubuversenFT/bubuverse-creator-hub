# LinkedIn Articles

This folder contains all long-form LinkedIn posts I publish daily.  
Each file represents one LinkedIn article with its own ideas, insights, and Web3 commentary.

### How files are organized
- article-01.md → Day 1 content  
- article-02.md → Day 2 content  
- article-03.md → Day 3 content  
(…and so on)

### What each article should include
- Title  
- Publication date  
- Main content  
- Optional images, notes, or screenshots
