## Title:  
BubuVerse: A Player-First Metaverse Built on Sustainable Tokenomics

## Summary:  
BubuVerse continues to expand with a focus on community-driven progression, fair rewards, and a sustainable in-game economy.  
Instead of relying on speculative mechanics, BubuVerse leverages Starlight Energy, evolving Bubus, and guild missions to create meaningful progression.  
The project uses Solana for fast transactions and low fees, and its roadmap is built around utility and long-term growth.
